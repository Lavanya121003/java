    Java is a high-level programming language,it is platform independent and object oriented programming language.
	it is written in notepad and executed in the complier it supports every system to complie.
	
	object-which is exist in the real world
	java is object-oriented programming language beacuse where the class can be create copies.
	
    java is platform independent beacuse it has an it is made up of os and hardware. 2

4.
  a.platform independent-it is combination of OS and hardware and java supports for various platforms.
  b.easy to understand-the programmers can easily identify the errors
  c.open source-java can be free of cost to download
  d.interpreted-java complies the source code into an byte code. 0.5
  
  

  
  
5.
   Datatype-to store what type of data.
   Datatype  has 2 types:
   1.primitive datatype
   2.non-primitive datatype
   1.primitive :
     1.byte- >128
	 2.short- >32000
	 3.int- >91141328904
	 4.long->to store phone numbers
	 5.float-to store decimal numbers
	 6.double-to store decimal numbers
	 7.boolean-true or false
	 8.char-single character('a')
	
	2.Non-primitive datatype:
	    1.String-to specify the names
		2.Sytem-it is an static variable
		3.Array-sequence of elements 1.5

6.variable-it is used to store information /values
 syntax:
        datatype refname;
 ex:
         int num;
	Types of variables:
	1.local-decalaring  a variable within a method.
	2.parameters-something (values)passing in the ().
	3.static -it also known as class 
	4.non-static-it is also known as instance. 0.5

   synatx:
           public static void method()
		   where public -access specifier
		   static-it is keyword
		   void- it is return type

  }
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Runner.open();
	}
}

 method is used in java becuase to invoke a method from the class.and get compiled in other classes.2
